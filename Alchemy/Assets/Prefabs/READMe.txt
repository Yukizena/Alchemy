Dear all
And mainly designers
In folder prefabs you will find all neccessary elements you can add to the scene you create
In folder enemies you will find elements connected with enemies like their models, fireballs, bosses ets
You are able to change some parameters within every prefab (like health, damage etc) just to adjust game balance to your taste and intuition
In folder obstacles you will find obstacles you can add to the scene which will decrease player health after interaction
Important parameter is should player be moved - if it is checked the obstacle will push away player where he/she/they stood (should be checked in case of holes) and if not it will let player stand in the obstacle (like in fire or something)
In folder PlayerThings you will wind element needed to create Player - player prefab, potion to throw, healthbar etc

If something is not in the folder yet it means it is not finished - you can use it but it might need come important corrects
