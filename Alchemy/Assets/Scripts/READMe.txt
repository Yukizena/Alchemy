Dear all
Mainly programmers and designers
In folder scripts there are all of proggraming pieces of work we were able to create
Folder PanPrzemo-skrypty containt scripts created by PanPrzemo which are tested and not finished
Folder fighting contains all the scripts for enemies and they should be added as components to right type of enemy prefab
Folder player contains scripts which should be a component of player or its children(like potion or rotating point) and allow player to do cool stuff
Folder Inventory contains scripts that do inventory things?
Folder others contains ready scripts which there was no idea where to put
Folder GameManager contains scripts which are there to control UI, changing scenes etc

If any script is not in particular folder it means its not ready or we have no fucking clue what it does.
